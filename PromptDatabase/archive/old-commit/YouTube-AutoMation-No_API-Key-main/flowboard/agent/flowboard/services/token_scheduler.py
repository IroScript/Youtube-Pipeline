"""Token freshness scheduler.

Google's ``ya29.*`` Bearer tokens (the ones the Flowboard extension captures
from the user's labs.google session) typically expire in ~1 hour. If the
humanless image-to-video pipeline runs a long batch (say 30 short clips =
~30 min of renders) we stay well under that limit, but Sonnet's review
pointed out the risk: a slightly larger batch + slow renders + a hiccup
could push us past expiry, and Google's first 401 would silently kill
every subsequent request in that batch.

This scheduler:

  1. Tracks the last token capture timestamp (``flow_client._token_captured_at``).
  2. Before each request, checks if the token is older than
     ``TOKEN_MAX_AGE_S`` (default 50 min — 10 min safety margin under
     Google's 1h expiry).
  3. If stale, sends a ``force_recapture`` WS message to the extension.
     The extension's existing ``captureTokenFromFlowTab`` runs a
     credentialed ``fetch('/fx/tools/flow')`` against the active Flow
     tab, which causes Google's SPA to re-issue an ``Authorization``
     header. The extension's network observer picks it up and pushes
     it to the agent via the existing ``token_captured`` WS event.
  4. Waits up to ``RECAPTURE_WAIT_S`` seconds for the new token to land.
     On timeout, raises ``TokenRefreshError`` so the caller can decide
     whether to abort the batch or skip the item.

This is intentionally a *thin* layer over ``flow_client`` — it doesn't
duplicate any Bearer logic. All it does is glue the time-based check to
the existing capture path.
